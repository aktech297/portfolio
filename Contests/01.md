### Adding invalid derivative contracts will break the protocol 

**Contest:** [Asymmetry]()

**Context** [SafEth.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L182-L194)

**Description**: 

Adding invalid derivative contracts will break the protocol

**Impact**:

The addition of invalid derivative contracts can severely hinder the functionality of the SafEth contract, rendering it useless until a new contract is deployed.


**Proof of Concept**

```solidity
  function addDerivative(
    address _contractAddress,
    uint256 _weight
  ) external onlyOwner {
    // @audit contractAddress can be 0?
    derivatives[derivativeCount] = IDerivative(_contractAddress);
    // @audit weight can be 0?
    weights[derivativeCount] = _weight;
    derivativeCount++;

    uint256 localTotalWeight = 0;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < derivativeCount; i++)
      localTotalWeight += weights[i];
    totalWeight = localTotalWeight;
    emit DerivativeAdded(_contractAddress, _weight, derivativeCount);
  }

```

The "addDerivative" function is used to add a new derivative contract to the list of existing derivatives stored in the contract. This function can only be executed by the contract's owner. The function requires two inputs, the address of the derivative contract to be added and its associated weight.

The function starts by adding the derivative contract to the "derivatives" mapping, associating it with the current count of derivatives stored. The weight of the derivative is also added to the "weights" mapping and associated with the current count of derivatives stored. The "derivativeCount" variable is then incremented to keep track of the number of derivatives stored.

Even though the function can be called only by the owner, that doesn't remove the fact that if the owner adds a derivative with not supported/zero address, it will brick pretty much all the functionality of the contract with no way to fix it except for deploying a new one.

The issue here is that if there's a corrupt/not supported/zero address derivative, the whole functionality of the protocol is bricked, because of two things:

1. All the calls to stake/unstake will revert, because the functions always go through derivativeCount and reference them through `derivatives[i]` to call `withdraw/deposit/ethPerDerivative`, etc.
2. There's no way change the corrupt/not supported/zero address derivative

The vulnerability itself is in the stake/unstake - the contract is always going through `derivativeCount` and references them by `derivatives[i]` which will revert if the address it's trying to call is not supported or it is a zero address. Meaning if there's a corrupt derivative, the whole functionality is bricked, because there's no way to change the `contractAddress` of already existing derivatives.

Last but not at least, adding a duplicate derivative can also be problematic for the protocol in various ways.

To prove this point, I've edited one of the [tests](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/test/SafEth.test.ts#L53-L81).

```typescript
describe("Large Amounts", function () {
    it("Should deposit and withdraw a large amount with minimal loss from slippage", async function () {
      const startingBalance = await adminAccount.getBalance();
      const depositAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("200");

      await safEthProxy.addDerivative(
        "0xc429dd84c9a9a7c786764c7dcaF31e30bd35BcdF",
        0
      );

      const tx1 = await safEthProxy.stake({ value: depositAmount });

      const mined1 = await tx1.wait();
      const networkFee1 = mined1.gasUsed.mul(mined1.effectiveGasPrice);

      const tx2 = await safEthProxy.unstake(
        await safEthProxy.balanceOf(adminAccount.address)
      );
      const mined2 = await tx2.wait();
      const networkFee2 = mined2.gasUsed.mul(mined2.effectiveGasPrice);
      const finalBalance = await adminAccount.getBalance();

      expect(
        within1Percent(
          finalBalance.add(networkFee1).add(networkFee2),
          startingBalance
        )
      ).eq(true);
    });
```

Running `yarn hardhat test ./test/SafEth.test.ts --grep "Should deposit and withdraw a large amount with minimal loss from slippage"`

Yields the following result:

Furthermore, I have confirmed that this is a legit issue after a discussion with the protocol team. Toshi agreed that it makes sense to add some kind of protection.

Taking into consideration the potential impact of the mentioned issues on the protocol's functionality and availability and refering to the [docs](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization) I would rate this vulnerability as a medium risk

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

To mitigate the issues associated with adding corrupt, not supported, zero address, or duplicate derivatives, the following approaches can be taken:

1.  **Allow removal of derivatives**: Modify the existing implementation by adding a function that enables the contract owner to remove derivatives from the protocol. This will allow for the removal of problematic derivatives that may have been accidentally added or are causing issues.
2.  **Implement positive validation and allowlisting**: Adopt a positive validation approach, where only whitelisted derivatives can be added to the protocol. Additionally, incorporate ERC165 standard for contract validation to ensure that only valid derivatives are added.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/introspection/ERC165.sol";

mapping(address => bool) public allowedDerivatives;

function allowDerivative(address derivative) external onlyOwner {
    allowedDerivatives[derivative] = true;
}

function disallowDerivative(address derivative) external onlyOwner {
    allowedDerivatives[derivative] = false;
}

function addDerivative(address derivative, uint256 weight) external onlyOwner {
    require(allowedDerivatives[derivative], "Derivative not allowed");
    require(ERC165(derivative).supportsInterface(/*derivative specific interface*/), "Invalid derivative");
    ...
}
```

3.  **Prevent duplicate derivatives**: Maintain a mapping of the currently added derivatives by their address key, ensuring that no duplicates are added to the protocol.
```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public isDerivativeAdded;

function addDerivative(address derivative, uint256 weight) external onlyOwner {
    require(!isDerivativeAdded[derivative], "Duplicate derivative");
    ...
    isDerivativeAdded[derivative] = true;
}

function removeDerivative(uint256 index) external onlyOwner {
    ...
    isDerivativeAdded[derivatives[index]] = false;
}
```
