### getRate() time difference can return 0

**Contest:**

**Context:**
[JUSDBankStorage.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-bytes032/blob/3ee27d445c203be47c3eca5ed2e5340ea488b2a7/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBankStorage.sol#L51-L57)


**Impact:**

%%The issue arises from the potential for multiple transactions in Arbitrum to have the same timestamp, leading to a time difference calculation of zero. This can result in unexpected and incorrect calculations when used in various contexts across the codebase. The impact can affect operations such as handling bad debt, borrowing, repaying, and calculating liquidation amounts.%%


**Description:**

```solidity
  function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        return
            t0Rate +
            (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) /
            JOJOConstant.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
    }
```


A single Ethereum block could consist of multiple Arbitrum blocks (In the event of heavy activity on the Arbitrum chain). Nonetheless, an Arbitrum block cannot span across multiple Ethereum blocks. 

Thus, any Arbitrum transaction is associated with exactly one Ethereum block and one Arbitrum block.

As per Arbitrum's [docs](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/Time_in_Arbitrum.md#ethereum-block-numbers-within-arbitrum), any timing assumptions a contract makes about block numbers and timestamps should be considered generally reliable in the longer term (i.e., on the order of at least several hours) but unreliable in the shorter term (minutes)

It is unreliable in a shorter term, because if multiple Arbitrum transactions are in a single L1 block, they could have the same block.timestamp.

This means around 20 transactions in Arbitrum can have the same block timestamp.

Running:
```bash
cast block --rpc-url https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/UVXidxBjyLOdMXEJxYtCMqqEkHATR2gQ 17169970
```

Yields the following result:

Then, running the script for 20 blocks further:
```bash
cast block --rpc-url https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/UVXidxBjyLOdMXEJxYtCMqqEkHATR2gQ 17169970
```

Yields the following result:

This proves that 20 distinct transactions in Arbitrum can have the same timestamp. 

This can be problematic for the `getTRateFunction`, because it calculates the difference by relying on the last updated timestamp and the current timestamp. Based on the information above, there are scenarios where the time difference calculation can return 0, which could lead to unexpected results.

The function is used heavily accross the codebase, which can lead to multiple and various consequences depending on the context:

When handling bad debt:
[JUSDBank.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-bytes032/blob/3ee27d445c203be47c3eca5ed2e5340ea488b2a7/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L512)

```solidity
 uint256 tRate = getTRate();
```

When borrowing:
[JUSDBank.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-bytes032/blob/3ee27d445c203be47c3eca5ed2e5340ea488b2a7/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L106-L117)

```solidity
   function borrow(
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bool isDepositToJOJO
    ) external override nonReentrant nonFlashLoanReentrant{
        //     t0BorrowedAmount = borrowedAmount /  getT0Rate
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
        _borrow(user, isDepositToJOJO, to, amount, msg.sender);
        require(
            _isAccountSafeAfterBorrow(user, getTRate()),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_BORROW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
```

When repaying:
[JUSDBank.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-bytes032/blob/3ee27d445c203be47c3eca5ed2e5340ea488b2a7/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L120-L127)

```solidity
    function repay(
        uint256 amount,
        address to
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[to];
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        return _repay(user, msg.sender, to, amount, tRate);
    }
```

To calculate liquidation amount:
[JUSDBank.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-bytes032/blob/3ee27d445c203be47c3eca5ed2e5340ea488b2a7/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L397-L401)

```solidity
       uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        require(
            _isStartLiquidation(liquidatedInfo, tRate),
            JUSDErrors.ACCOUNT_IS_SAFE
        );
```


**Recommendation:**

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to add a check in the `getTRate()` function to handle cases where the time difference is zero. By adding a fallback or alternative calculation, the function can avoid unexpected results when multiple transactions have the same timestamp. 

This safeguard ensures that the code accounts for the possibility of shared timestamps and maintains accurate calculations in such scenarios.
