### Paused dependencies can render the contract inoperable

**Contest:** [Asymmetry]()

**Context**: [SafEth.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L84-L91) 

**Description**:

The code exhibits a vulnerability where pausing the deposit or withdraw functionality of a derivative can render the entire contract inoperable. This can have a significant impact on users and disrupt normal contract operations. 

When staking, setting the paused derivative's weight to zero partially mitigates the issue, but the same cannot be applied when withdrawing. 

External calls within derivatives, such as StETH approval or frxETHMinterContract submission, can be paused, leading to transaction reverting and potential loss of functionality

**Impact:**

When the deposit or withdraw functionality of a derivative is paused, it can cause the whole contract to become inoperable, as the staking and unstaking functions are designed to call each derivative sequentially. This can significantly impact users and potentially disrupt the contract's normal operations.


**Proof of Concept:**

When staking ETH, the stake function goes through all the derivatives and calls their deposit function:

When staking ETH, the stake function goes [through all](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L84-L91) the derivatives and calls their deposit function.

```solidity
    for (uint i = 0; i < derivativeCount; i++) {
      uint256 weight = weights[i];
      IDerivative derivative = derivatives[i];
      if (weight == 0) continue;


      // @audit check for anomalies with truncation and with min/max msg.value
      uint256 ethAmount = (msg.value * weight) / totalWeight;

      // This is slightly less than ethAmount because slippage
      uint256 depositAmount = derivative.deposit{ value: ethAmount }();
```

The same applies when [unstaking](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L108-L118).

```solidity
function unstake(uint256 _safEthAmount) external {
    require(pauseUnstaking == false, "unstaking is paused");
    uint256 safEthTotalSupply = totalSupply();

    uint256 ethAmountBefore = address(this).balance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < derivativeCount; i++) {
      // withdraw a percentage of each asset based on the amount of safETH

      uint256 derivativeAmount = (derivatives[i].balance() * _safEthAmount) /
        safEthTotalSupply;

      if (derivativeAmount == 0) continue; // if derivative empty ignore
      derivatives[i].withdraw(derivativeAmount);
```


This can be problematic, because if the external calls in the deposit/withdraw functions of the derivative are paused, it will revert the whole transaction, even though all the other derivatives are working properly.

When staking, this can be kind of mitigated to extent by setting the paused derivative [weight to 0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/SafEth.sol#L87)

```solidity
    for (uint i = 0; i < derivativeCount; i++) {
      uint256 weight = weights[i];
      IDerivative derivative = derivatives[i];
      if (weight == 0) continue;
```

However, the same cannot be applied when withdrawing. Depending on the circumstances, the deposit functionality will be bricked until the protocol team sets the paused derivative weight to 0 OR the withdrawing functionality will remain completely bricked until... the dependency gets unpaused.

Here are some scenarios, where that can happen. When withdrawing, the issue could be within WstEth derivative. [It](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/WstEth.sol#L59) has an external call which is approval call to StETH.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    IWStETH(WST_ETH).unwrap(_amount);
    uint256 stEthBal = IERC20(STETH_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(STETH_TOKEN).approve(LIDO_CRV_POOL, stEthBal);
```

The issue is that the approval functionality of StETH might be [paused](https://etherscan.deth.net/address/0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84).

On the other hand, when depositing, the issue could be within SfrxEth. It's [deposit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/SfrxEth.sol#L101) function makes an external call to the frxETHMinterContract

```solidity
frxETHMinterContract.submitAndDeposit{value: msg.value}(address(this));
```

The problem here though is that [submitAndDeposit](https://etherscan.deth.net/address/0xbAFA44EFE7901E04E39Dad13167D089C559c1138) makes a call to `_submit`, which has a check which could be used to revert if its paused.

The same applies for [StETH](https://etherscan.deth.net/address/0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84#code)

Taking into consideration the potential impact of the mentioned issues on the protocol's functionality and availability and refering to the [docs](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization) I would rate this vulnerability as a medium risk

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Considering that the Reth derivative already includes a [poolCanDeposit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry/blob/44b5cd94ebedc187a08884a7f685e950e987261c/contracts/SafEth/derivatives/Reth.sol#L170) check, it is advisable to incorporate comparable features for all deposit and withdrawal functions. This is particularly important since the contract's staking and unstaking processes operate by iterating through each derivative sequentially.
